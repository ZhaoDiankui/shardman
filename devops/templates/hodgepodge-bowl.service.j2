# Each hp cluster is attended by separate bowl-keeper-etc set of service files.
# The main reason is that we can't make e.g. keeper@clustername_rgid_keeperid
# service require bowl@clustername; making one bowl manage all clusters doesn't
# look like a good idea either -- can't start/stop one cluster.
# data_dir is also hardcoded here during deployment since we need to arrange
# a place where to look for env files.
